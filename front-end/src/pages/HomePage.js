        My favorite Full-Stack manga website is a dynamic platform built using
        React.js for a smooth and responsive user interface, Firebase for user
        authentication and real-time database features, and MongoDB for storing
        a vast collection of manga titles. With Firebase, users can create
        accounts, log in securely, and track their reading progress across
        devices. The integration with MongoDB ensures a scalable database for
        managing and indexing manga content, allowing for fast searches and
        recommendations. The React front-end provides a seamless browsing
        experience with features like genre filters, bookmarks, and personalized
        recommendations, making it the perfect site for any manga enthusiast.
